Prinz


My name is Prinz. I am the second of 3 children from my parents. I like to think of myself as a goal getter considering the fact that my life was shaped by the situations around me. For example coming to America with no family/friends and surviving with on $400 in my pocket home/abroad. I think taking advantage of what life presents and making good of it is a good definition of who i am. I am here to win; irrespective of the circumstance.
