As a business oriented guy, i have ventured in to so many things, presently I'm partner with 5 other guys and we own a commercial real estate property here in maryland, we run a restaurant, dine in and carry out, clubing. Im a chef in grilling (suya) and now IT is going to be one of the things I have decided to venture into and particularly postgress because i was actually encouraged by a good friend of mine who knows my potential and vice versa. I am confident that this recommendation was a good one.
